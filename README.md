## Inspiration
COVID-19 inspired us to find a solution to help the elderly do tasks and get help. From that we came up with ErrandHelper, an on-demand gig service like Instacart but for everything. Here you can request general help such as "I need my TV set up" all the way to "I need someone to drop off a package for me." Our solution not only brings jobs that many have lost but also helps those who need to do things such as drop a package off and can't because of underlying health conditions or other extenuating circumstances.

## What it does
This app has a log-in page where you create an account to either post a job or do a job. Suppose you are looking for a gig, you will find it on the main page and can accept anytime (such as Instacart and accepting grocery deliveries). You can also post a gig such as "I need someone to drop a package off for me," post your ideal pay rate, then have someone within your city come and help you out for that amount of pay.

## How we built it
We used the Flutter Framework and Dart Programming Language with VS Code as our editor to code our app.

## Challenges we ran into
We had trouble integrating with Firebase as we were new to mobile development with a cloud based real time database.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud to have finished a basic working app that we can use to show the features and how it could be launched in the real world. We came into this project with almost 0 knowledge of building apps with Flutter so this was an amazing learning experience

## What we learned
How to use Flutter, how to work with people in various time zones!! (from USA to INDIA!)

## What's next for QuickErrand
We think this could be launched into a startup and could have potential- we got this idea from people complaining how they needed to do something but were scared of catching something such as COVID-19.
